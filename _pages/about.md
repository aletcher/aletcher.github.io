Previously: MSc in Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science @ <a href='https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-mathematics-and-foundations-computer-science'>University of Oxford</a>

Currently: working @ <a href='https://www.zurich.ibm.com/'>IBM Research Zurich</a>.

My [published research](https://aletcher.github.io/publications/) focuses on learning & game theory (with applications to GANs & multi-agent RL), but I'm equally interested in moving beyond curve fitting towards abstraction & reasoning.

Background: pure mathematics. I wrote my [bachelor thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/bsc_thesis.pdf) in algebraic number theory and my [master thesis](https://aletcher.github.io/assets/pdf/msc_thesis.pdf) on differentiable games, with applications to multi-agent learning.
